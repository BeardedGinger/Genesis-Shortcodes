The Genesis Shortcode Generator allows you to quickly add any default Genesis shortcodes as well as column shortcodes from your WYSIWYG

== Description ==

This plugin adds a button to your WYSIWYG, allowing for quick addition of default [Genesis Shortcodes](http://my.studiopress.com/docs/shortcode-reference/) as well as column shortcodes.

**Note**

The columns shortcodes require that the first column in the series contains a `position=“first”` within the shortcode.

**Possible Additions**

I’m typically not a fan of shortcodes but I do see the benefit for end-users. I’m considering adding other typical shortcodes to this plugin such as toggles, tabs, callouts, etc. 

Speak up in the forum if you think this is a good idea and if you have any ideas of other “regular” shortcodes that should be added.
